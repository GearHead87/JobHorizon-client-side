                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Access tokens and refresh tokens are used in authentication systems to grant access to resources on behalf of
                        a user. An access token is typically a short-lived token used to access protected resources, while a refresh
                        token is a long-lived token used to obtain new access tokens when they expire.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Access tokens are sent with each request to authenticate the user, while refresh tokens are securely stored on
                        the client side and used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                        Access tokens should be stored in memory (e.g., in browser memory or a secure storage mechanism) for security
                        reasons. Refresh tokens should be stored securely on the client side, such as in an HTTP-only cookie or secure
                        storage, to prevent unauthorized access.

                        Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web
                        applications and APIs. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and performance.

                        NestJS, on the other hand, is a progressive Node.js framework that uses TypeScript and is inspired by
                        Angular's architecture. It provides a structured and scalable way to build server-side applications,
                        incorporating modern design patterns and best practices.

                    <p className="mb-4">
                        NestJS offers features like dependency injection, middleware support, and modular architecture, making it ideal
                        for building complex and maintainable applications.

                        Hopefully, this blog post has helped clarify the concepts of access tokens, refresh tokens, Express.js, and
                        NestJS. If you're interested in learning more or trying out these technologies, check out the official
